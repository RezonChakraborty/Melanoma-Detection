# Melanoma-Detection
> To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

## General Information
- This model aim to detect Melanoma a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early.
- This project uses a dataset of about 2357 images of skin cancer types. The dataset contains 9 sub-directories in each train and test subdirectories. The 9 sub-directories contains the images of 9 skin cancer types respectively.


## Conclusions
- The model tends to overfit, by using a simple CNN network without any regularization.
- After performing data augmentation, the model tends to perform better and the overfitting problem is less significant.
- Perform class imbalance, tends to further detriorate the CNN model, along with applying certain regularization.
